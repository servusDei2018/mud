# GoMUD
A mud client written in Go. It currently handles basic ANSI color coding works with medievia.com. Just start the program and run the command "/connect medievia.com:4000" to start.

    /connect medievia.com:4000

## Warning
This is currently just a prototype, and the code has not yet been refactored. That being said, it shows how you can use tview to implement a basic skeleton required for a MUD client or an IRC client. 

Also, although it is a prototype, it is very usable. I've used it to play medievia for quite a few hours :D
